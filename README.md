# Type2-Diabetes-prediction
Abstract: India is home to over 60 million adults with diabetes (7.8% of the population), of which more than 30 million are undiagnosed or untreated, thus increasing the risk of developing complications and premature mortality. Diabetes is a growing threat nowadays, one of the reasons being that there is no perfect cure for it. This project aims to make a Data Science Model to Predict Type-2 Diabetes.  Idea brief: We will build a data science model to predict type-2 diabetes. It uses logistic regression to classify the diabetic outcomes of each person's record. The type-2 diabetes is commonly called diabetes mellitus. It can be defined as a chronic condition that affects the way the body processes blood sugar (glucose). We consider the mellitus here. After several researches we found that some parameters are directly responsible for the mellitus to occur. By using the data of the people with diabetes and without diabetes, a dataset will be built. We further use that dataset to classify the people who are in the risk of getting diabetes.  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K9vTrCNIMT-vb6awQoFjbeasIX9ca127jL0k_0o6rnA/edit?usp=sharing
