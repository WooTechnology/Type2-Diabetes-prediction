# Type2-Diabetes-prediction
Abstract-
This project aims to make a Data Science Model to Predict Type-2 Diabetes. 
India is home to over 60 million adults with diabetes (7.8% of the population), of which more than 30 million are undiagnosed or untreated, thus increasing the risk of developing complications and premature mortality. Diabetes is a growing threat nowadays, one of the reasons being that there is no perfect cure for it.
